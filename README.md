# Memory Card Game

This is a simple Memory Card Game project where players can test their memory by matching pairs of cards. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a part of a larger project that is being worked on, my Global Pastry Site that I am building in Django. I want to add options for picking other countries. I used favicon packs of country based icons for a fun little game to demonstrate using basic HTML CSS and JavaScript and fetching data from a JSON file i have hosted on GitHub. Eventually there will be more countries to choose from and will be integrated into my Django Site. 

## Features

- **Card Matching:** Flip cards and match pairs with the same image.
- **Timer:** Track the time it takes to complete the game.
- **Scoring System:** Calculate the player's score based on the number of moves and time taken.
- **Highest Score:** Save and display the highest score achieved.


## How to Play

1. **Flip Cards:** Click on cards to reveal their hidden images.
2. **Match Pairs:** Find matching pairs of cards.
3. **Winning:** The game is won when all pairs are successfully matched.
4. **Restart:** Restart the game at any time to try and beat your previous score.
